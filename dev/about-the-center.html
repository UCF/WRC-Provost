<strong>History</strong>
The Women’s Research Center was established in August, 2001 with support from the President and Provost under the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 2006 the WRC became one of the 10 centers and institutes under the Office of Research & Commercialization reporting to Dr. M.J. Soileau, Vice President for Research & Commercialization. In 2011, WRC moved back under the Provost’s purview, with direct reporting to Dr. Diane Chase, Executive Vice Provost, Academic, Faculty and International Affairs. WRC is now located in the Classroom 1 building, second floor, within the Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning (FCTL) suite. This move was designed to facilitate collaborations with the FCTL.
